          Partisan Management Group is a highly successful, early stage venture capital investor in medical device companies. Partisan has sought differentiation from other venture groups in four distinct ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The funds managed by Partisan are provided entirely by the two principals of the firm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Partisan begins by identifying large, unmet medical needs before clinical and investment focus by others. Partisan often creates or licenses intellectual property and initially forms a wholly owned new company.
          </li>
          <li>
            Partisan selects a management team whom the principals can treat as partners for the duration of the investment. A cooperative working relationship is enhanced, enabling management to purchase large amounts of founder's stock.
          </li>
          <li>
            Partisan principals use their years of industry experience to integrate a new company's operational needs and its investment needs, often acting as senior officers as well as board members. Partisan typically provides the founding round of capital and then leads a seed round with its network of angel investors or selected venture firms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The principals of Partisan have participated in sixteen medical device startups, of which three (Corvita, Novoste and AtriCure) have become public companies; ten (including two of the public companies) have been sold, and five are private operating companies. Four of the Partisan companies developed cardiovascular devices, three developed treatments or devices for renal diseases, two have developed minimally invasive surgical instruments, two treat neurological conditions, one pioneered a new dental implant, one developed new drug delivery technologies, one focused on aesthetic medicine, one developed ethnographically designed self-treatment kits for chronic diseases and one has developed a new catheter delivery system for interventional oncologists.
