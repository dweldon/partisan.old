            <a href="http://www.atricure.com/">AtriCure, Inc.</a> was started in November 2000 to develop instruments to treat atrial fibrillation by ablating areas of atrial tissue from outside the heart via a minimally invasive surgical approach, mimicking the classic Cox/MAZE procedure. The Series A and Series B financings were syndicated with USVP, Camden, Charter and Foundation Medical Partners. AtriCure completed an IPO in August 2005. Partisan and related entities invested $2.4 million in AtriCure, have sold a portion of our holdings for $7.5 million, and currently own approximately 2.2% of the Company.

            <a href="http://www.neuronetics.com/">Neuronetics, Inc.</a> was started via a purchase of intellectual property in July 2001. Partisan principals and Accuitive Medical Venture principals provided the seed funding. Subsequent financing has been provided by Accuitive, Three Arch, Investor Growth Capital, Interwest, Onset, Quaker BioVentures, KBL, New Leaf, Pfizer and Polaris. Neuronetics is commercializing a technology to non-invasively stimulate brain tissue with pulsed magnetic fields. The initial application is to treat depression. Two recently completed clinical trials have demonstrated that the company's treatment is highly effective in about 50% of drug-resistant patients. In October 2008 Neuronetics received FDA approval to initiate marketing. Partisan principals and the Weldon Foundation have invested $925,000 and own approximately 2% of the Company.

            <a href="http://www.ashaccess.com/">Ash Access, Inc.</a> was spun out of HemoCleanse in October 2003 to develop improved central venous and peritoneal catheters for hemodialysis patients. In 2007 Ash Access entered into a distribution and sale option agreement with AngioDynamics, Inc. for the catheter products. In addition, Ash Access developed a catheter lock solution named Zuragen that is used to prevent both coagulation and blood infections for patients using hemodialysis and other long-term, indwelling catheters. Initial clinical trial results for Zuragen have been positive. Subsequently, Ash Access developed a surgical preparation solution named ZuraPrep. Initial clinical trials of ZuraPrep indicate that it is superior to all presently marketed surgical preparations. ZuraPrep and other related assets have been spun out of Ash Access into a wholly owned subsidiary named Zurex Pharma, Inc. Partisan principals have invested $500,000 in Ash Access and own approximately 4% of the Company and its subsidiary.
